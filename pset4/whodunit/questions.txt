1.  stdint.h includes typedef's for width-specific integer types.
2.  Allows for greater portability and precision when defining integer types.
3.  BYTE is one byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, and WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  The first two bytes of a BMP file must be 'B' and 'M' (in ASCII).
5.  bfSize is the total size in bytes of the bmp file itself, while biSize is the
    size of the 'structure', presumably the image?
6.  The bmp is a "top-down" DIB, and its origin is the upper left corner (where the image starts)
7.  biBitCount defines the number of bits per pixel.
8.  If the file either doesn't exist, or cannot be opened for some reason (corrupted?)
9.  The third element of fread specifies how many 'data elements' we want to read of the specified
    size (the second element). We specify the size of an element before hand (the header, or the
    rgb triple), thus, we want to read each element at a time.
10. If bi.biWidth is 3, copy.c assigns a value of 3 to the padding (equal to one RGB triple, so as
    to ensure a multiple of 4)
11. fseek changes the changes the position indicator for the stream it points to.
12. The current position indicator of the stream/file.
